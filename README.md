## Getting Started

To get started, you can visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/zaki0521/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models/releases) to download the latest version of the code. Make sure to check for any updates regularly.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaki0521/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models.git
   cd Hands-On-Large-Language-Models
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   Use pip to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the models:**

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/zaki0521/Hands-On-Large-Language-Models/releases) to download the model files. Once downloaded, place them in the `models/` directory.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the code in various ways:

- **Run Example Scripts:**

  Navigate to the `examples/` directory and run any of the provided scripts:

  ```bash
  python example_script.py
  ```

- **Interactive Notebook:**

  Open the Jupyter notebook provided in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the models interactively. You can run each cell to see the results in real-time.

- **Custom Implementations:**

  Feel free to modify the existing scripts or create new ones to fit your needs. The code is designed to be flexible and easy to understand.

## Code Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the models.
- `examples/`: Includes example scripts demonstrating how to use the models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning.
- `models/`: Directory for storing downloaded model files.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for validating the functionality of the code.
